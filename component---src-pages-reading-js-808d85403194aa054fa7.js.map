Perhaps that's\n          the reason why my large collection of books continues growing every\n          day. This collection, of course, includes technical books of all\n          kinds. Books about a specific programming language or framework,\n          tutorials, career development books, etc.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I often joke that I have more books than I could possibly read in my\n          whole life, but I don't want that to be the truth, so in the last\n          couple of years I've tried being more intentional about my reading\n          habits. As I pick up new books, I'll list them here and, perhaps,\n          include a small review of them too. Who knows? Maybe someone else will\n          find them interesting too.\n        </p>\n      </article>\n      <hr\n        sx={{\n          color: \"#0b3c5d\",\n          textAlign: \"center\",\n          width: \"90%\",\n          border: \"none\",\n          borderTop: \"3px double #0b3c5d\",\n          overflow: \"visible\",\n          height: \"5px\",\n          my: 5,\n          \":after\": {\n            background: \"#eaeaec\",\n            content: '\"\\\\270E\"',\n            padding: \"0 4px\",\n            position: \"relative\",\n            top: \"-13px\",\n          },\n        }}\n      />\n      <h3>Recently read books</h3>\n      {JSONdata.map((group) => (\n        <>\n          <h4 sx={{ textAlign: \"left\", fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>{group.year}</h4>\n          <ul\n            sx={{\n              listStyle: \"none\",\n              display: \"flex\",\n              flexDirection: \"column\",\n              alignItems: \"flex-start\",\n              textAlign: \"left\",\n              m: 0,\n              px: 3,\n              py: 4,\n            }}\n          >\n            {group.books.map((book, index) => (\n              <li key={`books-${index}`} sx={{ marginBottom: \"2rem\" }}>\n                <span>\n                  <Link\n                    key={`books-${index}`}\n                    sx={{\n                      color: \"#328cc1\",\n                      textDecoration: \"none\",\n                      \":hover,:focus\": {\n                        color: \"#d9b310\",\n                      },\n                    }}\n                    to={book.link}\n                    target=\"_blank\"\n                  >\n                    {book.title}\n                  </Link>\n                </span>\n                <span>{` by ${book.author}`}</span>\n              </li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </>\n      ))}\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ReadingPage\n"],"names":["title","src","Books","alt","sx","border","padding","marginTop","my","textAlign","color","width","borderTop","overflow","height","background","content","position","top","JSONdata","group","fontWeight","year","listStyle","display","flexDirection","alignItems","m","px","py","books","map","book","index","key","marginBottom","Link","textDecoration","to","link","target","author"],"sourceRoot":""}
