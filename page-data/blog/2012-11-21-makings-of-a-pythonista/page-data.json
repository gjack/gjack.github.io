Each assignment is, in fact, a simplified version of some famous game, and we write all our code in an environment called CodeSkulptor, which was built by Scott Rixner, one of the instructors of the class. Creating interactive programs in Python is relatively easy, thanks to CodeSkulptor and the simplegui Python module, that provides the necessary methods to create our graphic user interface. All we really need to do is provide the logic for our game and then use the methods available in simplegui. Although simplegui will only work inside the CodeSkulptor environment, we can always achieve similar results using other available modules or packages, such as Tkinter and Pygame.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The second class also uses Python as the language of choice, although the main objective isn\\u2019t to learn Python but to teach you to think like a computer scientist and give you the tools to model and solve real world problems. Even though I had some experience with OOP, I signed up for this class because I thought it could be useful to me since my background is not in CS. I thought it could help me fill in the gaps on the fundamental knowledge I need. Far from being just a basic introduction for the newbie, though, this class is proving to be both challenging and interesting. I\\u2019m seven weeks into it already and still going strong, which makes me feel proud, to be honest.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I must say I\\u2019m liking this new model of education.
