As the customer\\u2019s original requirements kept changing, more information was given in small increments, and even new requirements were added to the list, it became pretty hard to implement and make sure that nothing was left to chance. I don\\u2019t know if my previous experience in QA helped any, but I do know that as I wrote my code, I kept thinking and testing all the possible ways it could break. At times it felt that was all I could do.

There\\u2019s no way to describe the feeling of satisfaction that comes from knowing that what you helped build is out there now, working exactly the way it was expected.

It is when you\\u2019re trying to claw your way out of that junior developer category, and you\\u2019re not exactly sure how to bridge the gap. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be a clear path between being junior and intermediate, or even a clear definition of who is a junior developer. It seems to me the category often includes recent grads, those that just taught themselves to code, those that just came out of coders bootcamp, and even those that have been developing code professionally for a few years. How many years? Are skills vs. time even considered? If so, what sort of skills make you intermediate?
