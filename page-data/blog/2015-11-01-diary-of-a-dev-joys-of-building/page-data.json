As the customer\\u2019s original requirements kept changing, more information was given in small increments, and even new requirements were added to the list, it became pretty hard to implement and make sure that nothing was left to chance. I don\\u2019t know if my previous experience in QA helped any, but I do know that as I wrote my code, I kept thinking and testing all the possible ways it could break. At times it felt that was all I could do. I didn\\u2019t have much time to write a complete test suite, and that made me feel very uncomfortable, but, sadly, days only have 24 hours and even excited coders need to sleep.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"However, what I did enjoy thoroughly from this experience was the act of creating.

There\\u2019s no way to describe the feeling of satisfaction that comes from knowing that what you helped build is out there now, working exactly the way it was expected.

It\\u2019s awesome!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now, I know for many devs out there this may not seem like a big deal, but it is when you\\u2019re a junior developer and you struggle with impostor syndrome from time to time. It is when you\\u2019re trying to claw your way out of that junior developer category, and you\\u2019re not exactly sure how to bridge the gap. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be a clear path between being junior and intermediate, or even a clear definition of who is a junior developer. It seems to me the category often includes recent grads, those that just taught themselves to code, those that just came out of coders bootcamp, and even those that have been developing code professionally for a few years. How many years? Are skills vs. time even considered? If so, what sort of skills make you intermediate?
